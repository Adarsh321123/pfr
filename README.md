The purpose of this repository is to hold a Lean4 formalization of <A HREF="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05762">the proof of the Polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa (PFR) conjecture</A> (see also <A HREF="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2023/11/13/on-a-conjecture-of-marton/">this blog post</A>.  The statement is as follows: if $A$ is a non-empty subset of ${\bf F}_2^n$ such that $|A+A| \leq K|A|$, then $A$ can be covered by at most $2K^{12}$ cosets of a subspace $H$ of ${\bf F}_2^n$ of cardinality at most $|A|$.  The proof relies on the theory of Shannon entropy, so in particular development of the Shannon entropy inequalities will be needed.
