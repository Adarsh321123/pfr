\begin{theorem}[Entropy version of PFR]\label{entropy-pfr}\uses{ruz-dist-def}
  Let $G = \F_2^n$, and suppose that $X^0_1, X^0_2$ are $G$-valued random variables.
  Then there is some subgroup $H \leq G$ such that
  \[
    d[X^0_1;U_H] + d[X^0_2;U_H] \le 11 d[X^0_1;X^0_2],
  \]
  where $U_H$ is uniformly distributed on $H$.denotes the uniform distribution on $H$.
  Furthermore, both $\dist{X^0_1}{U_H}$ and $\dist{X^0_2}{U_H}$ are at most $6 \dist{X^0_1}{X^0_2}$.
\end{theorem}

Probably need a definition for a uniform distribution on a non-empty subset $H$ of a set $S$.
