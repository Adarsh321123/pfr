  Suppose that $X_1,X_2$ are $G$-valued random variables such that
  $d[X_1;X_2]=0$. Then there exists a subgroup $H \leq G$ such that $d[X_1;U_H] = d[X_2;U_H] = 0$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} {\bf This proof will need to be deconstructed further, for instance by reading the proof in the cited paper.}
  By the triangle inequality, $\dist{X_1}{X_1} = 0$, and so (since $G=\F_2^n$) we have $\dist{X_1}{-X_1} = 0$. By Theorem 1.11(i) of {\tt https://arxiv.org/abs/0906.4387} it follows that there exists a subgroup $H$ with $\dist{X_1}{U_H} = 0$.
  Then $\dist{X_2}{U_H}=0$ follows by the triangle inequality.
\end{proof}
