\begin{proposition}\label{projections-1}
  \uses{ruz-dist-def, cond-dist-def,conditional-mutual-def}
  Let $\pi : H \to H'$ be a homomorphism between vector spaces over $\F_2$ and let $Z_1,Z_2$ be $H$-valued random variables. Then we have
  \[
    d[Z_1; Z_2] \geq d[\pi(Z_1);\pi(Z_2)] + d[Z_1|\pi(Z_1); Z_2 |\pi(Z_2)].
  \]
  Moreover, if $Z_1,Z_2$ are taken to be independent, then the difference between the two sides is
$$I( Z_1 - Z_2 : (\pi(Z_1), \pi(Z_2))  |  \pi(Z_1 - Z_2) ).$$
