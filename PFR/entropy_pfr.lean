# Entropic version of polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa conjecture

Here we prove the entropic version of the polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa conjecture.

## Main results

* `entropic_PFR_conjecture`: For two $G$-valued random variables $X^0_1, X^0_2$, there is some subgroup $H \leq G$ such that $d[X^0_1;U_H] + d[X^0_2;U_H] \le 11 d[X^0_1;X^0_2]$.
